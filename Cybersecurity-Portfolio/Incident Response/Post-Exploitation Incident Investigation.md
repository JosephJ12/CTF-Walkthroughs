# Post-Exploitation Incident Investigation

## Context
We detect post-exploitation activity on one of our VMs. We are tasked with investigating the following points:
1. Whether this is a false or true positive
2. If true, the actions taken by the threat actor
3. The impact and evidence of further compromise

## Attacker's Perspective
As the attacker, we gained local admin access via RDP to a Windows VM hosted on a company's Azure cloud network. With this acces, our goal is to enumerate as much as possible and find any information that can help in lateral movement or further compromise of the network. 

#### 1. Basic Enumeration
We first get a lay of the land by doing some basic enumeration using the following commands:
- `whoami`
- `whoami /priv`
- `tasklist /svc`
- `netstat antp`
- `whoami /groups`
